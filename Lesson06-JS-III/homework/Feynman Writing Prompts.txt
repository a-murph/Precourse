ARRAYS:
An array is an ordered list of values. Putting values (numbers, letters, strings, true/falses) into
an array is like stacking them on top of each other in a box to save for later. They are all in one
place and they are all in a particular order that you know. You can then use your knowledge of the
order the values are in to look at or take out or change any particular one.
