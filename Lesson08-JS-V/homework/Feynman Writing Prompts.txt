CONSTRUCTORS:
A constructor is a function that contains a set of instrctions for creating a certain kind of object.
For example, you might want to have a "person" object with properties such as hairColor, eyeColor,
height, and weight. But you will want to create more than one different "person" with different
values for all of those properties. So you would create a "person constructor", and then use it to
create different persons that are saved to different variables with different names.

PROTOTYPES:
An object's "prototype" is the blueprint for creating that kind of object. When you make a new
object, it "inherits" all of the properties and methods of its prototype. If you want to add a
property or method to every object of a particular type, you can add it to the prototype of those
objects, and they will all inherit the new properties or methods.
