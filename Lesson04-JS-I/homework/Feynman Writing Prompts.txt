VARIABLES:
A variable is a container for values. You can put a number, letter, word, etc. into it to hold onto,
and then take it back out whenever you need that number/word/etc. again, or replace it with another
one at any time.

STRINGS:
A string is text. It can be as short as one letter, or as long as many paragraphs. The computer 
treats strings like lists of letters in a particular order, like letter blocks placed next to each
other in a line to spell out words and sentences.

FUNCTIONS:
A function is a specific set of instructions for the computer that you will need to repeat to it
more than once. For example, you can create a "makeSandwich" function that has detailed instructions
on how to make a sandwich, and then whenever you need the computer to make a sandwich you can just
tell it to "makeSandwich" instead of repeating all of the step-by-step instructions.
Arguments are bits of information you give a function to work with. In a "makeSandwich" function you
might send the function some arguments telling it what ingredients you want it to use.
Return is how you tell the function to give something to you when it's done following its 
instrucitons. When the computer is done following the instructions in the "makeSandwich" function,
you need to tell it to give you the sandwich it made, or else the computer will just get rid of it.

IF STATEMENTS:
An "if" statement is a set of instructions that you only want the computer to follow sometimes. For
example, I could tell the computer "if there are enough ingredients, make a sandwich". If there are
enough ingredients to make a sandwich, the computer could then run the makeSandwich instructions. If
there are not enough ingredients, the computer will move on without doing anything.

BOOLEANS
A boolean is a value of "true" or "false". The computer considers these to be a special type of
value rather than just words. You can use these to tell the computer if certain conditions are true
or false.
