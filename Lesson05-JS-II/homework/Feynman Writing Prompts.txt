FOR
A "for" loop is a set of instructions that you want the computer to run a certain number of times.
You usually create a counter that counts up every time you go through the for loop, and then tell the
computer to stop repeating through the loo when the counter reaches a certain number.

&&, ||, !
"&&" means "and". It is used for when you want the computer to check if two different conditions are
both true.
"||" means "or". It is used for when you want the computer to check if at least one of a group of
conditions is true.
"!" means "not". It is used to reverse trues and falses. If you put an ! before something with a
value of true, it will be considered false, and if you put it before a false value it will be
condsidered true.
